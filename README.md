## Description

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository/project is to have a fair and comprehensive evaluation of other repositories/libraries/dependences/projects/etc... for which the evaluation is numerical and objective. 

### ACME Module Evaluator CLI

This repository contains a command-line tool designed to help ACME Corporation’s service engineering teams evaluate and select reliable open-source Node.js modules. The tool analyzes each module based on key metrics such as ramp-up time, correctness, bus factor, maintainer responsiveness, and license compatibility. Results are output in NDJSON format with detailed scores and latencies for each metric.

## File Documentation

### [Metrics](docs/metrics.md)

This code sets up a system for calculating metrics related to a GitHub repository, handling environment variables, logging, and making requests to the GitHub API. Below is an explanation of the key components:

### [Maintainability](docs/maintainability.md)

The `Maintainability` class calculates and evaluates the maintainability of a repository by analyzing its issue resolution time. This class extends the `Metrics` class and provides methods to assess maintainability based on the average time taken to resolve issues in the repository.

### [RampUp](docs/rampUp.md)

The `RampUp` class is responsible for evaluating how quickly a new contributor can ramp up on a repository. The ramp-up score is calculated based on the presence of key files and directories that are essential for understanding and contributing to the repository. This class extends the `Metrics` class.

### [Correctness](docs/correctness.md)

The `Correctness` class calculates the correctness of a repository based on its issues data. Correctness is evaluated by measuring the ratio of open bug issues to total open issues in the repository. This class extends the `Metrics` class and provides methods to evaluate the correctness.

### [BusFactor](docs/busFactor.md)

The `BusFactor` class calculates the bus factor of a repository. The bus factor is a measure of how many developers would need to leave a project before it becomes infeasible to maintain the codebase. This class extends the `Metrics` class and provides methods to evaluate the bus factor.

### [Responsiveness](docs/responsiveness.md)

The `Responsiveness` class evaluates the responsiveness of a repository by analyzing the time taken to respond to issues and pull requests. This class extends the `Metrics` class and provides methods to assess responsiveness based on the average response time to issues and pull requests.

### [License](docs/license.md)

The `License` class evaluates the license compatibility of a repository by analyzing the license types of its dependencies. This class extends the `Metrics` class and provides methods to assess license compatibility based on the license types of the repository’s dependencies.

### [NetScore](docs/netScore.md)

The `NetScore` class calculates the overall net score for a software project by combining several metrics such as BusFactor, Correctness, License, RampUp, and Maintainability. Each metric is weighted and contributes to the final score, which is computed as a weighted average. The score is clamped between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the best performance.

### [testUtils](docs/testUtils.md)

This module provides a set of assertion functions that compare actual values to expected values within specified thresholds. These functions log the results of the assertions, indicating whether they pass or fail.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galaxybomb23/ECE461-Software-Engineering
```

## Usage

All usage for this project is through the `run` executable.

### NOTE for WSL users:

You may encounter the following error when trying to run the checker/run script

```bash
bad interpreter: /bin/bash^M: no such file or directory
```

This is because windows saves the file using CRLF format while WSL expects it to be a LF format. To fix this you need to change the line ending for the file to LF. This can be done in VScode or using `dos2unix` and running the following command:

```bash
dos2unix run test.sh test/URLS.txt checker/one-url.txt
```

### Initial Setup

`cd` into the cloned directory.

Create a new file titled `.env` in the root of the repo. Copy and paste the text below into the file. Paste your GitHub API token in the quotes after `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Type the desired log level into the quotes after `LOG_LEVEL`. Paste the path of your log file in the quotes after `LOG_FILE`.

Log levels include:
|Debug|Level|
|--|--|
|0|Error|
|1|Info|
|2|Debug|

```
GITHUB_TOKEN = "<github_token>"
LOG_LEVEL = "1"
LOG_FILE = "logs/run.log"
```

Run the following command in a terminal while in the root of the repo to install the dependencies:

```bash
./run install
```

### Building

To build the project run the following command:

```bash
./run build
```

### Cleaning

To clean the project run the following command:

```bash
./run clean
```

### Test Bench

To run the test bench run the following command:

```bash
./run test
```

### Run with text file of URLs

To run the project with a text file of URLs run the following command:

```bash
./run <path/to/file>
```

and replace the `<path/to/file>` with the path of the text file you are trying to process. Make sure that the text file contains **1 URL per line**.
Ex.)

```
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js
https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm
https://www.npmjs.com/package/express
```

### ./test.sh

This script is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our metric equations. To run it use the following command:

```bash
./test.sh
```

## Known Limitations

- We do not utilize hermetic testing (i.e. mocking). As a result, the test bench will make API calls using your token. If external repositories change/receive pushes it's possible for our calculated metrics to change and fail some test cases.
